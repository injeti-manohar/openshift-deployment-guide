= Deploying a Lagom application to OpenShift

We will use the Lagom Shopping Cart example application for this tutorial. It is available for both Java and Scala, and uses a PostgreSQL database. Shopping Cart just provides a REST API, not a user interface, so we will interact with it using `curl`.

The following shows the build artifacts and runtime deployment architecture for Shopping Cart. The Shopping Cart example has two microservices; one that manages shopping carts, and one that tracks inventory levels. The shopping cart microservice communicates with the inventory microservice using Kafka. When a user completes the purchase, the shopping cart microservice sends a message to the inventory microservice.
